# scAbsolute
Measuring single-cell ploidy and cell cycle status in single-cell DNA sequencing data

This repository contains the source code for the scAbsolute software and scripts to replicate the figures in the manuscript.

In order to run the code, we recommend using the single-cell sequencing pipeline in
`https://github.com/markowetzlab/scDNAseq-workflow` which will be made available closer to publication.
